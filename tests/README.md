# Docker Puppeteer Example

This as an example of using the Docker Puppeteer docker image to run Mocha tests against a linked Docker Compose web service, and capturing a screenshot into a local `./screenshots` directory.

## Running

```shell
# Clone this example
git clone https://github.com/buildkite/docker-puppeteer.git
cd docker-puppeteer/example

# Build and run the example tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.integration-tests.yml run --rm tests

# See the screen that was generated
ls screenshots/

# Cleanup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.integration-tests.yml down --rmi all -v
```

You can also run
```bash
make test
```
